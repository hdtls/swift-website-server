Website is a cross-platform backend api application writtern for Swift.

## Supported Platforms
Website aims to support all of platforms where Vapor framework is supported. Currently, it is developed and tested on macOS and Linux.

## Documentation

## Example Usage
To build & run them, run following command, replace TARGET_NAME with what you have define in `Package.swift`.
```Shell
swift run TARGET_NAME
```
For example, to run books run following command:
```Shell
swift run Run
```

## Getting Started
Webiste primarily uses SwiftPM as its build tools, so we recommand using that as well,  and we use `gyb` as file generator to generate some supported files such as fluent models and linux tests, by default those file that can be generated by gyb is excluded from source control, so if you want to run code you should run generator first.

We provide a python script `build-script.py` to help you generate necessary files. you can run `python build-script.py --help` for more information.

### Using Xcode

To work on Books in Xcode 11+, you can just run the command:
```Sehll
python build-script.py --degyb-only
```
and then open the `Package.swift` file in Xcode and use Xcode's support for SwiftPM packages.

If your want to develop Website with Xcode, you have to generate an Xcode project:
```Sehll
python build-script.py --generate-xcodeproj
```

### An alternative: using `docker compose`
Alternatively, you may want to develop or test with `docker compose`.
First make sure you have Docker installed, next run the following commands, replace SERVICE_NAME with service name that you have defined in docker-compose file:
```Shell
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml run SERVICE_NAME
```
